<h2 style="text-align:center">Compiler Architecture</h2>

<p>The majority of real compilers share the same architectural features. They consist of a number of <em>passes</em>, each of which takes as input and returns as a result a certain <em>intermediate representation</em>, <em>IR</em>, (not necessarily the same) of a program being compiled. The concrete set of these passes and concrete forms of intermediate representations vary from a compiler to a compiler, but there are still some common representation which can be found throughout various implementations: <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, <em>three-address code</em>, <em>stack machine code</em>, <em>static single assignment</em> (SSA), etc. Some of these forms of representation will be utilized in our compiler, some others will be left out unused.</p>

<p>All the diversity of passes can be subdivided in a few categories.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="197" name="01-06.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/803e9692-37c9-4744-8174-5e93b2eff061/" width="567" /></p>

<p>First, the <em>frontend</em> of a compiler collects a number of <em>analyzing</em> passes: syntax analysis, type inference/checking, name resolution, etc.</p>

<p>Then, the <em>backend</em> of a compiler contains code generation passes: instruction selection, register allocation, instruction scheduling, low-level optimizations.</p>

<p>Finally, there can be <em>middle-end</em>, which comprised of various machine-independent optimising passes such as jump optimizations, dead code elimination, loop invariant code motion, common subexpression elimination, etc.</p>

<p>Most compilers allow to peep on what&#39;s going on under the hood. For example, <tt>GCC</tt> accepts the option <tt>-time-report</tt>, which makes it output the time taken by each pass performed. An example of such an output is shown below:</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Beyond Compilers</h2>

<p>While compilers, indeed, transform source programs to machine code, the code they output, as a rule, cannot be directly run on hardware. The reason is that it still contains certain abstractions the hardware cannot deal with. In particular, compilers usually generate assembler code with <em>symbolic names</em>. This approach plays an important role in supporting <em>separate compilation</em> &mdash; a feature which allows to combine programs from a number of precompiled modules. The majority of application programs make use of various libraries; as a rule, the source code of these libraries is not compiled alongside with the application itself, but <em>linked</em> at post-compilation time, thus greatly reducing the time required for build. To make it possible, compilers produce not ready-to-run binary code, but so-called <em>object files</em> which, besides machine code, contain supplementary <em>metadata</em> to make linking possible. Thus, on the way to the real executable binary the output which compilers provide is transformed again a number of times.</p>

<p>In the most general case, the compiler generates a textual assembler program. Then the following tools can be used:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>assembler</em> which reads assembler programs and outputs object files;</li>
  <li><em>archiver/librarian</em> which combines multiple object files into one archive/library file;</li>
  <li><em>linker</em> which combines multiple object and library files into one executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>These tools together with a compiler form so-called <em>toolchain</em>. When a new processor comes to market it is expected from the vendor to supply a conventional toolchain for the developers. In <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Unix</span>-like systems the conventional toolchain consists of separate programs <b>cpp</b> (C preprocessor), <b>cc</b> (C compiler), <b>as</b> (assembler), <b>ld</b> (linker) and <b>ar</b> (archiver). <tt>GCC</tt> compiler implements only two first of these components &mdash; <b>cpp</b> and <b>cc</b>, &mdash; and invokes others to complete the compilation process depending on what options were specified by users. The top-level program <b>gcc</b> itself is just a <em>driver</em> which controls the execution of other tools of the toolchain.</p>
