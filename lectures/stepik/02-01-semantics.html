\In this section we set the foundations for formal semantics which will be used in the rest of the course. We also discuss the
relation between programs and their representation in a concrete data domain, introduce the notion of interpreter and
consider some sample languages, their semantics and techniques for interpreter implementations.

<h2>Languages and Semantics</h2>

<p>
  We consider a programming language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal L\)</span> as a (countable) set of programs

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">
  \(\mathcal{L}=\{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_1,\,\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_2,\dots\}\)</span>
  To give a <em>semantics</em> for the language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal L\)</span> is to specify two objects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> a <em>semantic domain</em> <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal D\)</span>;</li>
  <li> <p>a <em>total</em> mapping <span class="math-tex">\([\![ \bullet ]\!]_{\mathcal L} : \mathcal L \to \mathcal D.\)</span></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Thus, for a program

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}\in\mathcal L
\)</span>
</p>

its semantics is just a

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]_{\mathcal L}\in\mathcal D
\)</span>
</p>
<p>
  When the language is easily deducible from the context we will omit the subscript and write simply <span class="math-tex">\([\![ \bullet ]\!]\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  By claiming the totality of <span class="math-tex">\([\![ \bullet ]\!]\)</span> we
  make sure that any program has some semantics. The nature of semantic domain <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal D\)</span> essentially defines the nature of <span class="math-tex">\([\![ \bullet ]\!]_{\mathcal L}\)</span>;
  for example, we can set

<p style="text-align:center">
  <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal D=\{\Cat\} \)</span>
  and (the only choice)</p>


<p style="text-align:center">
  <span class="math-tex">\([\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]=\Cat \)</span>
</p>

<p>
  for every <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}\in\mathcal L\)</span>. We admit that this particular
  semantics might not be very useful (this, however, depends on the nature of <span class="math-tex">\(<span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal L\)</span>\)</span>), but the important observations are that
</p>
<ul>
  <li> the choice of <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal D\)</span> has to be made;</li>
  <li> there might be (and, <em>as a rule</em>, are) multiple semantics for a given language.</li>
</ul>

<p>

  These various semantics for a language may reflect its various properties (and we will see some of those in a little while); however, as a rule, one particular
  semantics is chosen as the ``standard'' one.
</p>



<h2>Data Domain</h2>

<p>

  If we speak of a general-purpose programming language and interested in its execution semantics then, probably, we may consider choosing the semantic domain
  to be the set of all <em>partially-recursive</em>
  functions and <span class="math-tex">\([\![ p ]\!]\)</span> to be the function <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span> evaluates. This choice, however, would be too high-level and
  abstract for our purposes.
</p>
<p>

  To be more concrete, we first choose a <em>data
  domain</em> <span class="math-tex">\(\mathfrak D\)</span> to be the set of all reasonable data values the programs can take as inputs and
  produce as outputs; then the semantic domain for executable semantics would be

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\mathcal{D}:\mathfrak{D}\to\mathfrak{D}
\)</span>
</p>

<p>

  Thus, executable semantics maps programs to data-processing functions.
</p>

<p>

  In order to make further progress we stipulate the following properties of the data domain. First, we require its <em>closedness
  under product</em>:

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\mathfrak{D}\times\mathfrak{D}\subset\mathfrak{D}
\)</span>
</p>

<p>

  In other words, <span class="math-tex">\(\mathfrak{D}\)</span> contains all pairs, triples, etc. of its values.
</p>

<p>

  The next requirement follows from out intention to make
  <em>metaprogramming</em> possible. In short, the idea behind metaprogramming is
  to use <em>programs</em>
  as <em>data</em>. Indeed, all programming tools follow this approach: a compiler takes a program as input and
  returns (another) program as output, etc. This can be done only if programs can be
  <em>encoded</em> somehow in the data domain. We
  consider some concrete encodings, using \lama data domain later; for now we assume that for arbitrary programming language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>
  the set <span class="math-tex">\(\mathfrak{D}\)</span> contains the <em>representations</em>
  of all programs in <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>:

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\forall \mathcal{L}\; .\; \mathcal{L}\subset\mathfrak{D}
\)</span>
</p>

<p>

  We agreed above to consider programming languages as sets of programs; we could, equivalently, consider them as sets of
  <em>representations</em> of
  programs in some universal data domain. Since the correspondence between programs and their representations is one-to-one this convention would
  not hinder any follow-up reasonings. From now on we will not distinguish programs (abstract objects) from their representations (concrete objects)
  in <span class="math-tex">\(\mathfrak{D}\)</span>. Note, there can be multiple representations within one data domain, but all of them are ``equivalent'' in the sense that
  each pair of them admits an unambiguous conversions in both directions.
</p>

<h2>Semantic Properties</h2>

Let us have a language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> and its <em>two</em> semantics

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\begin{array}{rcl}
[\![ \bullet ]\!] & : & \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{D}\\
[\![ \bullet ]\!]^\prime & : & \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{D}
\end{array}
\)</span>
</p>

with the <em>same</em>
semantic domain. We say that these semantics are <em>equivalent</em>
if and only if for arbitrary program <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}\in\mathcal{L}\)</span>


<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]=[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]^\prime
\)</span>
</p>

In other words, equivalent semantics assign to each program in the language the same element of semantic domain. A question might arise why would we
need two equivalent semantics; wouldn't the single one be sufficient? The answer is that there are multiple ways of
describing semantics, and these different ways have different properties which make them preferable in different settings. Sometimes it is desirable to
reformulate the semantics in different terms. By proving the equivalence between the two we can justify that we still deal with the language with the same
semantic properties.

Note, when the semantic domain is domain of functions <span class="math-tex">\(\mathfrak{D}\to\mathfrak{D}\)</span>, the equation above denotes the equality of functions: for
arbitrary <span class="math-tex">\(x, y\in\mathfrak{D}\)</span>


<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]^\prime\,x=y \Leftrightarrow [\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]\,x=y
\)</span>
</p>

In other words, in both semantics <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}\)</span> is defined on exactly the same inputs and for each of these inputs it provides the same outputs.

Another important property is <em>equivalence of programs</em>
within the same semantics. We say that \displaystyle{\textbf{p_1}} is (semantically) equivalent to \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_2
(notation: <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_1\equiv\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_2\)</span>) if and only if

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_1 ]\!]=[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_2 ]\!]
\)</span>
</p>

Thus, equivalent programs have the same semantics. The equivalence of
<em>different</em> programs within the same semantics plays a crucial
role in justifying the correctness of program transformations. Let us have some transformation of programs into programs:

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
f : \mathcal{L}\to\mathcal{L}
\)</span>
</p>

We say that <span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span> is <em>semantically correct</em>
if and only if for all programs <span class="math-tex">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>
<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
\sembr{f\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}})}
=[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]
\)</span>
</p>

Thus, equivalent transformations do not change the semantics of programs; they can, however, change other their properties.

When the semantic domain is domain of functions, the equation above, again, denotes the equality of functions; additionally,
the following important notion can be introduced in this case. We say that <span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span> is <em>partially correct</em> if and only if
for all programs <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}\)</span> and all <span class="math-tex">\(x, y\in\mathfrak{D}\)</span>

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]\,x=y\Rightarrow\sembr{f\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}})}\,x=y
\)</span>
</p>

The difference between correctness and partial correctness is that in the former case the programs are defined for exactly the same inputs,
while in the latter the transformed program can be defined even if the original one in not. To some extent this is how
optimizing transformations work, as we've seen in the previous chapter.

Finally, there can be transformations between <em>different</em>
languages with the <em>same</em>
semantic domain. Let us have two languages <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>
and let their semantics be

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\begin{array}{rcl}
[\![ \bullet ]\!]_\mathcal{L} & : & \mathcal{L}\to\mathcal{D}\\
[\![ \bullet ]\!]_\mathcal{M} & : & \mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{D}
\end{array}
\)</span>
</p>

We say that a transformation

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
f : \mathcal{L}\to\mathcal{M}
\)</span>
</p>

is <em>semantically correct</em>
if and only if for all programs <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}\)</span>


<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
[\![ \displaystyle{\textbf{p}} ]\!]_\mathcal{M}=\sembr{f\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}})}_\mathcal{L}
\)</span>
</p>

And, again, when <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> is a domain of functions the equation above denotes the equality of functions, and the notion of
partial correctness arises. One example of transformation between languages is compilation; as we already know, compilers as a rule
are partially correct.


<h2>Interpreters, Compilers, Specializers</h2>

We already mentioned compilation as a syntactic transformation from one language to another; we also
talked of compilers as programs which implement compilation. Here we consider them and some other useful
transformations in the form of programs in more details.

Let <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> be two languages, and

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
\begin{array}{rcl}
[\![ \bullet ]\!]_{\mathcal L} & : & \mathcal{L} \to \mathfrak{D} \to \mathfrak{D}\\
[\![ \bullet ]\!]_{\mathcal M} & : & \mathcal{M} \to \mathfrak{D} \to \mathfrak{D}
\end{array}
\)</span>
</p>

--- their semantics. An <em>interpreter</em>
for language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>,
written in language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>,
is a program <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\Int{L}{M}\in\mathcal{M}\)</span>, such that for each
program <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\in\mathcal{L}\)</span>
and each data value <span class="math-tex">\(x\in\mathfrak{D}\)</span>


<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

  \sembr{\Int{L}{M}}_\mathcal{M}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\times x) = \sembr{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}}_\mathcal{L}\,(x)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {(\star)}
\)</span>
</p>

To some extent an interpreter
<em>implements</em> the semantics of a programming language: given a program and its input it provides exactly the same result
this program calculates. Of course there can be many interpreters for a given pair of languages; any program <span class="math-tex">\(\mathbf{i}_\mathcal{M}\)</span> satisfying equation <span class="math-tex">\((\star)\)</span>,
e.g. such than

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
\forall \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L},\,x\in\mathfrak{D}\,.\,\sembr{\mathbf{i}_\mathcal{M}}_\mathcal{M}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\times x)=\sembr{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}}_\mathcal{L}\,(x)
\)</span>
</p>

is an interpreter.

A particular interesting kind of interpreter is <em>self</em>-interpreter
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\Int{L}{L}\)</span>, i.e. an interpreter which interprets the language of its own implementation.
In the computability theory such interpreters are known under the name ``<em>universal
  functions</em>'', and it is proven than universal functions exist for
all Turing-complete languages.

Another interesting program is, of course, a compiler. Given languages <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>,
<span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>,
and <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{N}\)</span>, a compiler from
<span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal L\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal N\)</span>
, written in a language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal M\)</span>
, is a program <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Comp}[3]{\mathbf{comp}^{\mathcal {#1}\to\mathcal{#2}}_{\mathcal {#3}}}
\Comp{L}{N}{M}\in\mathcal M\)</span> such that
for all programs <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\in\mathcal L\)</span>
and all input data values <span class="math-tex">\(x\in\mathfrak{D}\)</span> the following equation holds:

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
  \newcommand{\Comp}[3]{\mathbf{comp}^{\mathcal {#1}\to\mathcal{#2}}_{\mathcal {#3}}}

  \sembr{\sembr{\Comp{L}{N}{M}}_\mathcal{M}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L})}_\mathcal{N}\,(x) = \sembr{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}}_\mathcal{L}\,(x)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {(\star\star)}
\)</span>
</p>

Indeed, a compiler takes a program representation <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span>
as input and produces another program, <span class="math-tex">\(
    \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
  \newcommand{\Comp}[3]{\mathbf{comp}^{\mathcal {#1}\to\mathcal{#2}}_{\mathcal {#3}}}

  \sembr{\Comp{L}{N}{M}}_\mathcal{M}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L})\)</span>,
this time in the language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{N}\)</span>,
which gives exactly the same result as <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span>
for any input <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>.
And, again, any program <span class="math-tex">\(\mathbf{c}_\mathcal{M}\)</span> satisfying
the equation <span class="math-tex">\((\star\star)\)</span> is a compiler.

Finally, there can be a program called <em>specializer</em>
<span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \Spec{L}{M}\)</span>,
written in a language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal M\)</span>
for a language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal L\)</span>, such that for
all programs <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\in\mathcal L\)</span>
and all data values <span class="math-tex">\(x, y\in\mathfrak D\)</span>


<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
    \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
    \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

  \sembr{\sembr{\Spec{L}{M}}_\mathcal{M}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\times x)}_\mathcal{L}\,(y)=\sembr{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}}_\mathcal{L}\,(x\times y)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {(\star\star\star)}
\)</span>
</p>

Informally, a specializer takes as input a program <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span> and
<em>one</em> of its inputs <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>
and builds a program in the same language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal L\)</span> which
takes <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>
~--- the remaining inputs of <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span>,
~--- and provides exactly the same result as <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span>
for both <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>. The existence of specializers is,
again, guaranteed by the computability theory (<em>Kleene <em>s-m-n</em>--theorem</em>).

It's worth discussing why (and, actually, when) these programs exist. Obviously, if both <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> are Turing-complete, there exist both <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\Int{L}{M}\)</span>
and <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\Int{M}{L}\)</span> (why?).

<h2>Futamura Projections</h2>

We now study a few elegant theoretical constructs which connect together the notions of interpreters, compilers and specializers. To simplify the presentation we
introduce the following denotation

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
    \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
p_\mathcal{L}=\sembr{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}}_\mathcal{L}
\)</span>
</p>

for a program <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span>.
Thus, while <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{L}\)</span>
is a program in a language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> (i.e. a syntactic object),
<span class="math-tex">\(p_\mathcal{L}\)</span> is
its semantics (a function in the data domain).

Our first step is to apply a specializer <span class="math-tex">\(
    \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \Spec{L}{M}\)</span>
to some interpreter <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\Int{N}{L}\)</span>
and some program <span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N}\)</span> it can interpret:

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
    \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
    \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
  \newcommand{\IntS}[2]{{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

  \sembr{\underline{\SpecS{L}{M}\,(\Int{N}{L}\times \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N})}}_\mathcal{L}\,(x)=\IntS{N}{L}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N}\times x)=\sembr{\underline{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N}}}_\mathcal{N}\,(x)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {(I)}
\)</span>
</p>

The first equality follows immediately from <span class="math-tex">\((\star\star\star)\)</span>
while the second~--- immediately from <span class="math-tex">\((\star)\)</span>. Let's now look at the underlined parts. The
<em>right</em> one is, obviously,
<span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N}\)</span>,
a program in the language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{N}\)</span>. The <em>left</em>
one is some program in the language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>. The equation itself states that the semantic of these
two programs give the same value for every input <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>. In other words, these two programs are equivalent. This is the first Futamura projection:

<q>

<em>The specialization of an interpreter for a program gives the representation of this program in the language of
  interpreter implementation.</em>
</q>

Next, let's specialize a specializer for an interpreter:

<span class="math-tex">\(
\newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
  \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

\begin{equation}
\sembr{\sembr{\underline{\SpecS{M}{K}\,(\Spec{L}{M}\times\Int{N}{L})}}_\mathcal{K}\,(\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N})}_\mathcal{L}\,(x)=\\
\sembr{\SpecS{L}{M}\,(\Int{N}{L}\times \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N})}_\mathcal{L}\,(x)=
\sembr{\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_\mathcal{N}}_\mathcal{N}\,(x)\tag{II}
\end{equation}
  \)</span>

The first equation, again, immediately follows from <span class="math-tex">\((\star\star\star)\)</span>,
while the second~--- from <span class="math-tex">\((I)\)</span>. If we look at the underlined part long enough, it becomes
evident that it is a program in the language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>
which satisfies the equation <span class="math-tex">\((\star\star)\)</span>,
i.e. a compiler <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Comp}[3]{\mathbf{comp}^{\mathcal {#1}\to\mathcal{#2}}_{\mathcal {#3}}}
\Comp{N}{L}{M}\)</span>. This is a second Futamura projection:

<q>
<em>The specialization of a specializer to an interpreter gives a compiler from the interpreting language to the
  language of interpreter implementation.</em>
</q>

Finally, we can specialize a specializer to a specializer:

<p style="text-align:center">
<span class="math-tex">\(
    \newcommand{\sembr}[1]{\llbracket{#1}\rrbracket}
\newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

  \sembr{\SpecS{K}{T}\,(\Spec{M}{K}\times\Spec{L}{M})}_\mathcal{T}\,(\Int{N}{L})=\SpecS{M}{K}\,(\Spec{L}{M}\times\Int{N}{L})\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {(III)}
\)</span>
</p>

<p>

  The equation immediately follows from <span class="math-tex">\((\star\star)\)</span>;
  its right part, according to <span class="math-tex">\((II)\)</span>,
  is <span class="math-tex">\(
  \newcommand{\Comp}[3]{\mathbf{comp}^{\mathcal {#1}\to\mathcal{#2}}_{\mathcal {#3}}}
\Comp{N}{L}{M}\)</span>. This is the
  third Futamura projection:
</p>

<q>
  <em>The specialization of a specializer to a specializer gives a compiler generator which for an interpreter generates a
    compiler from
    the interpreting language to the language of interpreter implementation.}
  </em>
</q>
<p>
  Futamura projections are named after Y.Futamura, who described the first two of them in the beginning of 1970s. All
  three
  projections were independently discovered by V.Turchin and A.Ershov, who gave them their current name.
</p>

<p>
  The beauty of Futamura projections is that they give a rather simple equations for rather complex tools like compilers and compiler generators.
  However, this immediately raises a question if one can indeed acquire these tools using such a high-level description.
</p>

<p>
  Let's assume that we are going to use Futamura projections to implement a compiler from \lama to <tt>x86</tt>. Then
  we, first, need an interpreter
  <span class="math-tex">\(
\newcommand{\lama}{\lambda\kern -.1667em \hbox{a}\kern -.1000em \hbox{$\mathcal M$}\kern -.1000em \hbox{a}\ }

    \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\Int{\lama}{\texttt{x86}}\)</span> for \lama written in \texttt{x86} assembler. The task of implementing such
  an interpreter, while involving
  some low-level programming, does not look very challenging. Then, we need a specializer
  <span class="math-tex">\(
\newcommand{\lama}{\lambda\kern -.1667em \hbox{a}\kern -.1000em \hbox{$\mathcal M$}\kern -.1000em a\ }
\newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \Spec{\texttt{x86}}{\mathcal{L}}\)</span> for \texttt{x86}
  assembler written in some language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>, not necessarily \lama. We can choose any suitable language for this purpose.
  Having both at hands, we will be able to compile \lama-programs to \texttt{x86} code using the first Futamura projection:
</p>
<p>
  <span class="math-tex">\(
\newcommand{\lama}{\lambda\kern -.1667em \hbox{a}\kern -.1000em \hbox{$\mathcal M$}\kern -.1000em a\ }

    \newcommand{\Int}[2]{\mathbf{int}^{\mathcal {#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}

  \SpecS{\texttt{x86}}{\mathcal{L}}\,(\Int{\lama}{\texttt{x86}}\times
  \displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_{\lama})=\displaystyle{\textbf{p}}_{\texttt{x86}}
  \)</span>

  And here comes the hard part: the simplest possible specializer (for example, that guaranteed by the
  <em>s-m-n</em>--theorem) would produce a very
  poor machine code; it would, in fact, just link the interpreter with the program, which invalidates the very idea of
  compilation. In order to
  acquire a decent result, the specializer has to be non-trivial. The task of developing a non-trivial specializer even
  for the first Futamura
  projection is non-trivial as well; nevertheless there are frameworks where this task is solved. For example,
  <tt>GraalVM</tt> uses the first Futamura projection
  as a tool for language bootstrapping.
</p>
<p>
  If we move higher in the Futamura projection hierarchy we would need at least one additional specializer
  <span class="math-tex">\(
      \newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \Spec{L}{L}\)</span>, this time
  for the language <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>;
  it can be written in the <span class="math-tex">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> as well. This specializer has to be even more
  advanced than
  <span class="math-tex">\(
\newcommand{\lama}{\lambda\kern -.1667em \hbox{a}\kern -.1000em \hbox{$\mathcal M$}\kern -.1000em a\ }

\newcommand{\Spec}[2]{\mathbf{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
\newcommand{\SpecS}[2]{{spec}^{\mathcal{#1}}_{\mathcal {#2}}}
  \Spec{\texttt{x86}}{\mathcal{L}}\)</span> since we expect it to decently specialize more complicated program, than
  interpreters.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, for the third Futamura projection we need even more advanced specializer since it has to be capable of
  decently specialize specializer for a
  specializer. Note, is the third Futamura projections the last two specializers need not necessarily be the same
  programs, but it is very
  appealing from both scientific and aesthetic standpoints to have the single, <em>self-applicable</em>, specializer.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, using Futamura projections beyond the first one in practice is still a hard venture. In the middle of 1980s all three projections were
  implemented by the group led by N.Jones, but this was rather a proof-of-concept than a working industrial technology.
