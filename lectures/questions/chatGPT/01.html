Why is formal semantics important in programming languages?
A. It allows for efficient analysis of programming languages.
B. It enables the mathematically proven results.
C. It helps to create a better user interface for programming languages.
D. Both A and B.

What is the importance of compilers in the context of programming languages?
A. Compilers are rarely developed "once and for all."
B. They are semantic-sensitive development instruments.
C. They are used to write programs.
D. Both A and B.

What are the other important tools besides compilers?
A. IDEs, model checkers, static analyzers, debuggers, profilers, etc.
B. Programming languages, semantics, and pragmatics.
C. Syntax, grammar, and tokens.
D. All of the above.

What is the role of intuition in programming languages?
A. Intuition is essential for compilers to clean up code mess.
B. Intuition helps programmers to write better code.
C. Compilers do not have intuition.
D. None of the above.




, fuzzy understanding of programming constructs
c. To develop system-level programming tools, especially compilers
d. To write simple code

What should be the results of the expression "0*(x/0)"?
a. Zero
b. Undefined
c. One
d. Cannot be determined

Why do developers write snippets with murky semantics?
a. To make their code complex
b. To create an antipattern
c. Because they lack intuition
d. Because they want to challenge compilers

Why is it important for programming languages and compilers to have strong semantic foundations?
a. To develop system-level programming tools
b. To interpret the semantics of programs in a coherent way
c. To create an antipattern
d. To challenge compilers

What is the role of metaprogramming tools in programming?
a. To write complex code
b. To generate programs that contain vacuous use of constructs and programming language features
c. To create an antipattern
d. To challenge compilers

What is the reason why compilers do not find anything "weird" in code snippets like "0*(x/0)"?
a. They have intuition
b. They routinely convert program texts into executables
c. They are programmed to find antipatterns
d. They challenge developers.
